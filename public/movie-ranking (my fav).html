 <h3>Spider Man no way home</h3>
 <P>With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is 
    unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the 
    high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the 
    stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.</P>

 <h3>Batman</h3>
 <P>His origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder 
    of his parents, Thomas and Martha, as a child, a vendetta tempered by the ideal of justice. He trains
     himself physically and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night.</P>

 <h3>The Black Panther</h3>
 <p>After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. 
    When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn
    into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king 
    must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.</p>
