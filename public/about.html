<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm an introvert with a strong passion for aviation, photography, and creative design. I completed my National Service 
  in the Singapore Armed Forces as a Guardsman, where I earned a Gold award for my Individual Physical Proficiency Test 
  (IPPT) and completed the Casualty Care Aid Course (CCAC). Recently, I’ve been diving into the world of IT, with a particular 
  focus on web development and design. While math and coding haven’t always come naturally to me, I’ve found myself increasingly 
  drawn to coding—especially front-end development—as a way to blend my creativity with technology. I’m excited to deepen my programming 
  skills and build a meaningful career in this space. Outside of work, I enjoy capturing moments through photography and spending time plane spotting.

<p>I’m a motivated and adaptable professional with a background in field, web development, known for bringing creative 
  solutions, strong communication, and a growth-oriented mindset to every project. I enjoy working in dynamic environments
   where I can contribute to meaningful results. I value continuous learning and seek opportunities that challenge me to grow
    personally and professionally. Outside of work. </p>
